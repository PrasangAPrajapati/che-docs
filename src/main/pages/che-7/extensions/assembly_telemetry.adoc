= Telemetry

Telemetry is the transparent and ethical collection of the usage data. By default, telemetry is not available in the {prod}, 
but there is an abstract API that allows enabling telemetry via the plugin mechanism. This approach is used in the link:{site-baseurl}che-7/hosted-che/[Hosted Che] where telemetry is enabled for every workspace.

== Use cases

Eclipse Che telemetry API allows tracking:

* Duration of workspace usage.
* User-driven actions like file editing, committing and pushing to the remote repositories
* The list of plugins enabled in the workspace
* Programming languages and link:{site-baseurl}che-7/making-a-workspace-portable-using-a-devfile/devfiles[devfiles] used in the workspaces

== How it works?
